Like most of you I assume, my group of friends and I faced a new problem during the quarantine situation : how to continue our gloomhaven campaign online?
Our favorite way to do it was by placing a camera above the board, video share it to everyone, and use Gloomhaven Helper to track the game state. But since you can't manage each player' s deck of modifiers and abilities with it, we built another web app! You can use it to build your ability and modifier decks and manage your cards (discard, destroy, draw, etc.) If you want to try it, it's here:

https://www.gloomhaven-deck.com/

Nightly version:

We hope you find it as useful as we do! Feedback is very welcome, and don't hesitate to signal any bugs in the issue tracker

# How to install

If you find the deployed version slow, can can clone this repository and run it on your own machine. 
- Either directly open the `index.html` file with your favorite browser. This will work but the cookies won't be saved
- Run it locally on a HTTP Server. [Python's SimpleHttpServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) works great for that.
